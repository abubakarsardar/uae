      <h1>1. H.H Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan:</h1>

    </div>
    <div class="first_leader">
      <div class="first_leader_info">
        <p>In 1918, His Highness Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan , may God bless his Soul, was born into the Al Nahyan
          family, who had ruled the emirate of Abu Dhabi for hundreds of years. He was the youngest of the four sons of
          Sheikh Sultan bin Zayed, who ruled Abu Dhabi from 1922 – 1926. When Sheikh Sultan’s successor died in 1928,
          Sheikh Zayed’s eldest brother, Sheikh Shakhbut, was elected by the family to be ruler.</p>
        <h4>Family and early life</h4>
        <p>Zayed was the youngest of four sons of Sheikh Sultan bin Khalifa Al Nahyan. His father was the ruler of
          Abu Dhabi from 1922 until his death in 1926. Zayed was the youngest of his four brothers. His eldest
          brother, Sheikh Shakhbut bin Sultan Al Nahyan, became ruler of Abu Dhabi after their uncle, Saqr bin Zayed Al
          Nahyan, His mother was Sheikha Salama bint Butti.She extracted a promise from her sons not to use
          violence against each other, a promise which they kept. Sheikh Zayed was named after his grandfather,
          Sheikh Zayed bin Khalifa Al Nahyan ("Zayed the Great"), who ruled the emirate from 1855 to 1909. At the
          time of Sheikh Zayed's birth, the sheikhdom of Abu Dhabi was one of seven Trucial States along the lower coast
          of the Persian Gulf. He also showed interest in falconry.</p>
        <h4>Career and reign</h4>
        <p>Zayed was appointed the governor of the Eastern Region of Abu Dhabi in 1946, and was based in the Muwaiji
          fort in Al Ain. At this time, the area was poor and prone to outbreaks of disease. When parties from Petroleum
          Development (Trucial Coast) began exploring for oil in the area, Zayed assisted them.
          <br>
          In 1952, a small Saudi Arabian force led by Turki bin Abdullah Al-Otaishan occupied the village of Hamasa in
          the Buraimi Oasis (the 'Buraimi Dispute'). Zayed was prominent in his opposition to Saudi territorial claims
          and reportedly rejected a bribe of about £30 million to allow Aramco to explore for oil in the disputed
          territory. As part of this dispute, Zayed and his brother Hazza attended the Buraimi arbitration tribunal in
          Geneva in September 1955 and gave evidence to tribunal members. When the tribunal was abandoned amid
          allegations of Saudi bribery, the British initiated the reoccupation of the Buraimi Oasis through a local
          military force, the Trucial Oman Levies.
        </p>
        <h4>Attitudes</h4>
        <p>Sheikh Zayed was determined to unite the Emirates into federation. His calls for cooperation extended across
          the Persian Gulf to Iran. He advocated dialogue as the means to settle the row with Tehran over three
          strategic Persian Gulf islands which Iran seized from the (future) UAE Emirate of Sharjah in 1971. The islands
          remain in Iranian hands, despite over three decades of UAE diplomatic initiatives.

          The attitude of Zayed towards his neighbors can best be seen[opinion] in his position regarding the "Umm al
          Zamul" dispute (1964), when he expressed a genuine wish that his brother Sheikh Shakhbut would accept "the
          Sultan's proposal for a neutral zone". He said in that regard: "... it was ridiculous to squabble over a
          [water] well so bitter that few bedouin could stomach its waters, or to split hairs over a tiny area of
          barren, almost totally unfrequented desert. And even if there happened to be oil in the area, Abu Dhabi had so
          much already that she could well afford to spare some for her less fortunate neighbours"</p>
        <h4>Policies and charity</h4>
        <p>At the time the British withdrew from the Persian Gulf in 1971, Zayed oversaw the establishment of the Abu
          Dhabi Fund for Arab Economic Development; some of its oil riches were channeled to some forty less fortunate
          Islamic nations in Asia and Africa during the decades that followed.[33][page needed]

          Using the country's enormous oil revenues, Zayed built institutions such as hospitals, schools and
          universities and made it possible for UAE citizens to enjoy free access to them. He was also known for making
          donations to the tune of millions [pounds sterling] for worthy causes around the Arab World as well as in the
          neighbouring countries and in the world at large.</p>

      <h1>2. H.H Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan:</h1>

    </div>
    <div class="first_leader">
      <div class="first_leader_info">
        <p>HH Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Ruler of Abu Dhabi, was elected as the new President of the United
          Arab Emirates on 3 November 2004, to succeed his father, the late HH Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, UAE
          President from 1971 to 2004, from whom, he has said, he learned “the need for patience and prudence in all
          things.”
        </p>
        <h4>Family</h4>
        <p>Khalifa is the eldest son of  Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan and  Hassa bint Mohammed bin Khalifa Al Nahyan.
          He is married to Shamsa bint Suhail Al Mazrouei, and he has eight children: Sultan, Mohammed, Shamma,
          Salama, Osha, Sheikha, Lateefa and Mouza.
          <br>
          He succeeded to the posts of Emir of Abu Dhabi and President of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) on 3 November
          2004, replacing his father Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, who had died the day before. He had been acting
          president since his father became ill prior to his passing.

          On 1 December 2005, the President announced that half of the members of the Federal National Council (FNC), an
          assembly that advises the president, would be indirectly elected. However, half of the council's members would
          still need to be appointed by the leaders of the emirates. The elections were set to take place in December
          2006.
        </p>
        <h4>Investments and foreign aid</h4>
        <p>Seychellois government records show that since 1995 Sheikh Khalifa has spent $2 million buying up more than
          66 acres of land on the Seychelles' main island of Mahé, where his palace is being built.[32] The Seychelles'
          government has received large aid packages from the UAE, most notably a $130 million injection that was used
          in social service and military aid, which funded patrol boats for the Seychelles' antipiracy efforts. In 2008,
          the UAE came to the indebted Seychelles government's aid, with a $30 million injection.[32]
          <br>
          Sheikh Khalifa paid $500,000 for the 29.8-acre site of his palace in 2005, according to the sales document. A
          Seychelles planning authority initially rejected the palace's building plans, a decision overturned by
          President James Michel's cabinet.[32] A month after the start of construction of the palace, the national
          utility company warned that the site's plans posed threats to the water supply. Joel Morgan, the Seychelles'
          minister of the environment, said the government did not tender the land because it wanted it to go to Sheikh
          Khalifa. Morgan said "the letter of the law" might not have been followed in the land sale.

          the death of Sheikh Maktoum bin Rashid Al Maktoum.Sheikh Mohammed embodies energetic and successful
          leadership. He is a man who has made promises and kept them; he has insisted on excellence and achieved
          nothing less; he has defined the role of leadership and fulfilled it.
        </p>
        <h4>Early life</h4>

          went to Dubai Secondary School. In 1966, with his cousin Mohammed bin Khalifa Al Maktoum, he attended the Bell
          Educational Trust's English Language School in the United Kingdom.He subsequently

          with the sword of honour as the top Commonwealth student.He also traveled to Italy to train as a pilot.
        </p>
        <h4>Political career</h4>
        <p>On his return from military training to Dubai, Sheikh Mohammed's father appointed him as the head of the
          Dubai Police Force and the Dubai Defence Force, which later became a part of the Union Defence Force.[27][28]
          <br><br>
          Minister of Defence:
          <br>
          As a young man, in January 1968, he was present when Sheikh Rashid and Sheikh Zayed first met in the desert
          between Dubai and Abu Dhabi at Argoub El Sedira[29] to agree to the formation of a union of emirates following
          British notification of intent to withdraw from the Trucial States. When the new nation of the United Arab
          Emirates was founded on 2 December 1971, he became its first Minister of Defence at the age of 22.</p>
